Analyse how AI decisions affect flight trajectories and efficiency metrics.

  

3\\. Optimising AI Agent Performance  

Continuously fine\\-tune the AI agent by analysing its performance in various scenarios, adjusting hyperparameters, and enhancing its learning process to improve decision accuracy and sustainability outcomes.

  

4\\. Scenario Analysis \\& What\\-If Modelling  

Use the AI agent to run ""what\\-if"" scenario analyses on different flight paths and air traffic situations. Help explore various resolutions to conflicts and evaluate their impacts on safety, and trajectory efficiency.

  

5\\. Data Collection \\& Processing  

Collaborate with the data engineering team to ensure that relevant aviation data is fed into the AI model. Work on extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) processes to cleanse and prepare data for simulation and AI training.

  

6\\. Collaboration and Communication  

Work closely with your Mentor and Team Leads to ensure that your activities are in line with the defined objectives. Share your findings, insights, and recommendations with cross\\-functional teams.

  

7\\. Continuous Learning and Exploration

The team’s goal is to create, train, adapt, and improve an AI agent based on reinforcement learning (e.g. Deep Q\\-Network). As a non\\-AI module will handle conflict detection leveraging a deterministic approach, the AI model will optimise decision\\-making based on different types of conflict\\-trajectory resolution strategies, each offering specific characteristics (hence varying rewards in the AI model’s training) in terms of trajectory efficiency and consequently, its sustainability.

  

Under the guidance of your Mentor and Team Lead, you will play a pivotal role in enhancing our Data Science and AI capabilities to support the development of innovative aviation solutions.

**Responsibilities:**


As a Data Science Intern focusing on AI, you will contribute to AIR Lab’s simulation and procedure modelling efforts for trajectory optimisation and conflict resolution in aviation. Your responsibilities include:

Participate in the design, training, and improvement of the AI agent. This will include setting up the Deep Q\\-Network for reinforcement learning, defining reward mechanisms for each type of clearance, and evaluating the AI's performance in simulation scenarios. Analyse how AI decisions affect flight trajectories and efficiency metrics.

  

3\\. Optimising AI Agent Performance  

Continuously fine\\-tune the AI agent by analysing its performance in various scenarios, adjusting hyperparameters, and enhancing its learning process to improve decision accuracy and sustainability outcomes.

  

4\\. Scenario Analysis \\& What\\-If Modelling  

Use the AI agent to run ""what\\-if"" scenario analyses on different flight paths and air traffic situations. Help explore various resolutions to conflicts and evaluate their impacts on safety, and trajectory efficiency.

  

5\\. Data Collection \\& Processing  

Collaborate with the data engineering team to ensure that relevant aviation data is fed into the AI model. Work on extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) processes to cleanse and prepare data for simulation and AI training.

  

6\\. Collaboration and Communication  

Work closely with your Mentor and Team Leads to ensure that your activities are in line with the defined objectives. Share your findings, insights, and recommendations with cross\\-functional teams.

  

7\\. Continuous Learning and Exploration  

Stay up to date with the latest advancements in reinforcement learning and AI for aviation. Participate in workshops, training sessions, or other learning opportunities – for instance, those provided by the AIR Lab.

**Requirements:**


Educational Background: Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related discipline.  

AI/ML Learning Skills: Basic understanding or coursework in reinforcement learning, particularly in Deep Q Networks or similar frameworks.  

Programming Skills: Proficiency in Python and familiarity with data science libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch). Experience with data manipulation libraries like Pandas and NumPy is a plus.  

AI/ML Knowledge: Understanding of AI/ML models and their application to real\\-world problems, particularly in optimisation and decision\\-making. Prior experience in AI/ML projects is beneficial.  

Aviation Interest: A strong interest in aviation or air traffic management, with an understanding of how AI can impact sustainability and efficiency in this domain. Prior experience in aviation projects is an advantage.  

Problem\\-Solving Skills: Ability to tackle problems creatively, think critically, and develop innovative solutions.  

Collaboration \\& Communication: Ability to work effectively in a multidisciplinary Team and communicate technical concepts clearly.


Commitment: Able to commit on a full\\-time basis for ideally 6 months (or a minimum of 5 months) from May/June 2025 onwards.

**Learning Outcomes/Benefits**:

* Opportunities for professional development and hands\\-on experience with cutting\\-edge
* AI and reinforcement learning techniques.
* Collaborative and innovative work environment.
* Chance to work on impactful aerospace projects that contribute to sustainable aviation globally.
